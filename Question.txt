​
Before You Start: Read the Style Guide
Read the style guide sections 1, 2, and 3. You should follow the conventions laid out in the PEP 8 – Style Guide
for Python Code

Telestar, the company you work for as a software engineer, wants to implement some new functionalities to the
mobile money service you helped create the last time. You have been recruited to work on implementing these
new exciting services!
These new services will be implemented as functions, so first, you will have to modularize the existing service
using functions in the format of the attached file named “momo_application_with_functions.py”
The customers, with an initial amount of GHS 1000 and a 4-digit MOMO PIN “7209”, should be given the
following options on the main menu when they dial the hashcode *150#:

Welcome to Telestar Mobile Money! Please select an option:
●​ Transfer Money
●​ MOMO Pay
●​ Airtime and Bundles
●​ Allow Cash Out
●​ My Wallet

Part A: Transfer Money
In the wake of increased mobile money scammers, Telestar wants to ensure customers have secure
transactions. To do this, ensure that
●​ The MOMO number is verified before the transaction amount is input

●​ Transactions between Telestar network users registered to the MOMO service have user names
displayed before transactions are authorized. The list of Telestar customers and their phone numbers to
be used are in the “Telestar Customer List” excel file.
●​ the customer’s MOMO PIN is used to authorize the transactions

Test Case 1
>>>
Enter your choice: 1
Transfer Money:
1. TeleStar Network
2. Other Networks
Enter your transfer choice: 1
Enter the recipient's TeleStar phone number (should start with 059): 05920979359
Verify the phone number by entering it again: 05920979359
Enter the amount to transfer: 50
Enter your MOMO pin to authorize transfer to ABASS, Osman: 7209
GHS 50.0 has been sent successfully to ABASS, Osman, with E-levy charge of GHS0.5
Service charge: GHS 0.2
New balance: GHS 949.2
Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no):
Part B: MOMO Pay Option
The added service charges that come with ordinary mobile money transactions make it an unsuitable option for
transacting with businesses. This service, MOMOPay, allows customers to enter the Merchant ID associated
with given ventures so payments can be made with no service charges. The vendor names and vendor
(merchant) IDs to be used are in the “Merchant List” excel file.

MomoPay/Paybill:
Enter the 6-digit Merchant ID: 558032

New balance: GHS 899.0
Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no):

Part C : Airtime and Bundles
Telestar wants to give customers more data bundles options outside of the available fixed ones. This will be
made possible with the Flexi_Bundle option. With this, a customer can purchase any amount of data for
varying prices in the range, GHS 0 to GHS 400, given the following assumptions:
●​ The cost per each MB is 0.01786

●​ The amount of data you receive = Amount/Cost per MB plus a bonus of 5% the input amount.

Part D : Allow CashOut
To expedite cashouts, a new feature will be implemented: after a user initiates a cashout, a random vendor
from the merchant list will prompt the user to cash out a random amount. Security is key, so the cashout
prompt only goes through after the user authorizes it using their MOMO pin.

1. Yes
2. No
Enter your choice: 1

services :
